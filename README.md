Once files have been save into a working directory a one more step will need to take place, and that is to install node_modules. The node_modules will include: dotenv, express, mysql12, sequelize, faker, express-session, express-handlebars, bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize"

To install the node_modules properly one will need to type in the terminal under the current working directory for the application:

```bash
npm i
```

Make sure that you are in the directory that these files have been saved to. Otherwise you will be intalling the node_modules to the wrong directory, and thus will not allow the appliation to work.
